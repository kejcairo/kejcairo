        <p>Dear Jane,</p>
        <p>As I sit down to write this letter, I find myself overwhelmed with a sense of longing and nostalgia. The days without you have felt incomplete, and I can't help but think about all the wonderful moments we've shared.</p>
        <p>From the laughter we've shared to the quiet moments of comfort, you have become an integral part of my life. The warmth of your presence, your smile, and your companionship are things I dearly miss.</p>
        <p>Distance may physically separate us, but please know that you are always in my thoughts and in my heart. Each passing day only reinforces how much you mean to me and how much I cherish the times we've spent together.</p>
        <p>I eagerly await the day when we can be together again. Until then, remember that my thoughts and affection are with you no matter where you are. I eagerly anticipate the moment when we can create new memories and continue our journey together.</p>
        <p>Stay well, take care, and know that I'm counting down the moments until we can be reunited.</p>
        
        <p>Missing you dearly,</p>
      <p>Kej</p>
